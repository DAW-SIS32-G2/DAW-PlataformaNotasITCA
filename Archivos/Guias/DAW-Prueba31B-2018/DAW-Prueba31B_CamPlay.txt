1.  Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Media Players have become large complicated applications that depend
on the latest Windows features (e.g. the current version of DirectX).
The common Media Players have also become a battleground for streaming
formats, entertainment portals, advertising, etc.  These players tend
to be optimized for entertainment content and are often simply not
appropriate for playing screen recordings.  Camtasia Player is
designed to guarantee simple high quality playback of your Camtasia
Studio videos.

Camtasia Player is a simple, standalone video player, optimized for
playing screen recordings.  Camtasia Player always plays movies at
100% of their original size so that they remain readable.  It runs
on any 32-bit Windows platform, with no dependencies on runtime
libraries, OS version, or DirectX.  The Player is a single .EXE file
that does not need any setup, nor does it use the registry or any
configuration files.  Camtasia Player is designed to be as easy to
use as possible to avoid support issues.  Command line options are
provided which allow Camtasia Player to be invoked in various ways
from CD-ROMs, multimedia authoring tools, and scripting languages or
batch files.  The command line options are listed below in the "How
to Use Camtasia Player" section.

Camtasia Player only plays AVI video files.  Beginning with v2.0,
Camtasia Player has built-in support for the TechSmith Screen Capture
Codec (TSCC).  This means that an AVI encoded with the TSCC codec
will always play in the Camtasia Player, even if the TSCC codec is
not installed on the system.  Any other audio or video codecs
required by the AVI file must be installed before Camtasia Player can
play the movie. Camtasia Player does not setup any shell associations
to become the default AVI player.  However, this could be setup by an
install program that you provide, or by an end user.

Please refer to CAMPLAYLICENSE.TXT for details about the software
license agreement and about redistribution of Camtasia Player
(CAMPLAY.EXE) with your Camtasia movies.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  System Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run Camtasia Player, your system must meet these
specifications:

o  Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or later version
o  Windows-compatible sound card and speakers (recommended)
o  About 640 KB of hard-disk space for program installation
o  Any audio or video codecs required by your AVI files must be
   installed in order to play the AVIs.

   ** Note: Beginning with v2.0, Camtasia Player can play AVIs encoded
   with the TechSmith Screen Capture Codec (TSCC), even if the TSCC
   codec is not installed on the system.  However, you may still wish
   to install the TSCC codec so that the AVIs will play in other media
   players.  You can freely distribute and install the TSCC video
   codec using the TSCC.EXE codec installer, included with Camtasia
   Studio.

4.  How to use Camtasia Player
----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Command Line Parameters

    When you launch Camtasia Player, by default it has a title bar,
    a menu bar, a tool bar, a status bar.  You can customize those
    elements by specifying arguments on the command line when
    launching Camtasia Player.  Here is the exact syntax for the
    command line arguments:

       CAMPLAY [<options>] [<file>]

    where <file> is an optional movie file name and <options> is an
    optional set of options among the following:

    /A    - Launches with "Always on top" option
    /BC RGB(255,0,255) - Set background color, default is black
    /D    - Launches without allowing "Dragging" by the movie area
    /E    - Exits after playing the movie
    /F    - Launches in Full Screen Mode
    /M    - Launches without a menu bar
    /MX   - Launches with its window maximized
    /open - Open the specified movie (<file>) but does not play it
    /play - Immediately play the specified movie (<file>) [default]
    /R    - Repeats the movie forever
    /S    - Launches without a status bar
    /ST   - Stay on last frame after playing
    /T    - Launches without a title bar
    /TB   - Launches without a tool bar

    Notes:
    - For the /BC background color, you must supply a color argument
      with the syntax RGB(r,g,b) where r, g, and b are the red, green
      and blue components of the color.  Valid values for r, g, and b
      are in the range 0 to 255.  For example:
         RGB(0,0,0)        =  black
         RGB(255,255,255)  =  white
         RGB(0,0,255)      =  blue
         RGB(128,128,128)  =  dark gray
      The background color shows only when the movie that is playing
      does not fill the entire frame.  For example, if the player is
      maximized while a 360x240 movie is playing, the background color
      will show. 

    Examples:
    CAMPLAY "movie1.avi"
    - play "movie1.avi" with the default user interface

    CAMPLAY /E /F "movie2.avi"
    - play "movie2.avi" full screen and exit after playing

    CAMPLAY /M "movie3.avi"
    - open "movie3.avi" without a menu bar (i.e. no File>Open menu
      option)

    CAMPLAY /BC RGB(128,128,128) /F "movie4.avi"
    - play "movie4.avi" full screen and fill the background with dark
      gray if the movie does not fill the entire screen.

  v4.0.0  No change.

  v3.1.1  Camtasia Player now available in Japanese and Korean.

  v2.1.1  Fixed playback problems with some 256 color AVIs.  A default
          palette was used instead of the actual palette contained in
          the AVI, causing some colors to appear distorted.

  v2.1.0  Added drag and drop support to the player.

  v2.0.5  Camtasia Player now available in German.

  v2.0.4  Added a warning to inform the user of possible playback
          problems for AVI files which exceed 1GB.

  v2.0.3  Changed program logo and icon for consistent branding with
          Camtasia Studio 2.x.

  v2.0.2  Changed program logo and icon for consistent branding with
          Camtasia Studio 1.x.

  v2.0.1  Internal changes only.  No visible changes to the player.

  v2.0.0  The player can now play AVI files which use the TechSmith
          Screen Capture Codec (TSCC) even if the codec is not
          installed on the system.

          Added /ST "Stay on last frame" option.  When a movie
          finishes playing, instead of rewinding to the beginning of
          the movie, the player will stop on the last frame.

          Added /BC "Background color" option.  This command line
          option requires a parameter of the form RGB(red,green,blue)
          which specifies the red, green, and blue components that
          make up the the background color.  Valid values for the red,
          green, and blue components are in the range 0 to 255.  The
          background color only shows when the movie is not big enough
          to fill the frame.

          Added volume controls to the player.

          Improved seeking performance.  You can now seek while the
          movie is playing.  You can now click anywhere on the slider
          to jump to that point in the movie.  You can also use the
          left and right arrow keys for frame by frame navigation.

  v1.0.4  Added /A "Always on top" option to keep player on top of
          other windows.  The Play>Always on top option only appears
          if the /A command line option is used.

          The player can now be moved around the screen by a click-n-
          drag inside the movie playback area. No dragging is allowed
          when the player is maximized or when in fullscreen mode. For
          backward compatibility, the /D option was added to disable
          this "Dragging" behavior in case it is not desired.

          Added Exit toolbar button when the player is run with no
          menu (/M) and with no title bar (/T) to make it easier to
          close the player.

          Fixed problem where player would forget its window position
          due to the sequence: maximize, enter fullscreen, exit full-
          screen, restore.

          Fixed problem where player was not positioned correctly in
          the window z-order when switching out of fullscreen mode.

          Fixed initial refresh problem on NT4 when /t /mx were used.

  v1.0.3  Fixed problems with Camtasia Player not exiting or repeating
          at the the end of a movie (/E and /R command line options).

          Fixed excessive flashing when playing a clip with palette
          shifts on a 256 color desktop with Camtasia Player.

          Fixed problems with the player stopping unexpectedly when
          dragging the seek bar.

          Added Play>Repeat menu option.

  v1.0.2  Change the command line parsing to understand options
          without spaces.

  v1.0.1  Added the Space bar as an accelerator key for Play/Pause.

  v1.0.0  Initial release.
